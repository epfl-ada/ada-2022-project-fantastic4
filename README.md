### Question 1
We will plot the evolution of the different distributions over time. We will be particularly careful on the period of aggregation in order to have significant results, and more generally the number of data available per variable (e.g number of films per genre).

Another important point will be to take care of potential counfounders or interaction between variables (e.g maybe there are more fantastic movies taking place in the U.S than in Europe).
